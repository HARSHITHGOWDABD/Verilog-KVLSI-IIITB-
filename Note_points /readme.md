VHDL vs VERILOG 
1.VHDL is a typed language and it is very difficult to understand
2.verilog is similar to c programing, c is a procedural/sequential  and verilog is concurrent programming language.
3.Test bench is used to generate the stimuli 
4.for every design we will write in IP and VIP 
5.It is used for simulation and synthesis 
6.we can write the code without fabrication technology
7.Introduced by Gorden Bell and Alen Newell
8.Design flow diagram 
9.First implimentd by prabugoyal , phil moorby by gatway automation later become cadence -1995
10.In dut the first step is module and declaration of input and output ports
11. eloberate the design by using diffrent modelling style
12.In test bech the module is without ports and input as reg and out as wire (behavioral modelling)
13.Instanciate the dut and then stimuky geneation , capture and then publish the result 
14.It is case sencitive and extencition is .v
15.gate , structural , dataflow (rtl), behavioral , switch level of modelling
16.comments (//) for multiple (/*),
17.Rules of Identifier ,all keywords are in lower case,
